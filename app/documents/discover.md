  RealSync exposes local ports over the internet, handling HTTP and TCP traffic. It allows secure remote access to local devices, web services, APIs, and databases. An internal API Gateway experience, now powered by Kong, will manage HTTP routes, virtual domains, and facilitate a VPN-like experience through a Chrome plugin.

- **Cloud Environment:**  
  AWS is the main cloud provider. Deployments rely on Elastic Beanstalk with Docker containers, RDS (PostgreSQL) for persistence, CloudWatch for monitoring/logging, Route 53 and ACM for domain and SSL certificate management. Traffic initially passes through Cloudflare’s WAF for cost-effective security and then into AWS.

- **Messaging & Dynamic Routing:**  
  NATS is used for inter-instance messaging to synchronize state and routing information. Kong serves as a dynamic API Gateway/Proxy layer, allowing real-time adjustments to traffic routing rules without rebuilding or redeploying the entire environment.

- **Observability & Security:**  
  CloudWatch provides fundamental monitoring and logging. Future integration with Grafana/ElasticSearch is possible. All traffic is encrypted (TLS/SSL), IAM controls resource access, and data at rest is encrypted with KMS. With custom domains and certificates, clients maintain end-to-end encryption. Kong also integrates well with this stack for metrics and logging, providing insights into routing decisions.

## Key Components

1. **Cloudflare WAF & DNS:**  
   - Cloudflare’s WAF inspects and filters incoming requests before they reach AWS.  
   - Cloudflare DNS routes requests to the AWS environment for further processing, reducing malicious traffic and providing a cost-effective security layer.

2. **Load Balancer (Elastic Load Balancer):**  
   - Receives filtered traffic from Cloudflare (HTTP/HTTPS, TCP).
